#
# Reproducible plugin build
#
# Builds any plugin in this monorepo into a .phar inside a container, so a build needs no local PHP,
# Composer or toolchain — only Docker. It mirrors what .github/workflows/build.yml does: merge the
# shared repository list, install production dependencies, then pack the plugin.
#
# A GitHub token is REQUIRED. Composer reads repository metadata through the GitHub API, which allows
# only 60 requests an hour unauthenticated — shared across everything on your address, so a cold
# build reliably fails without one. Pass it as a BuildKit secret, never as a build argument: build
# arguments are recorded in the image and recoverable with `docker history`, whereas a secret is
# mounted only for the length of one RUN and never reaches a layer.
#
#   export GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
#   docker build -f docker/build-plugin.Dockerfile \
#     --secret id=github_token,env=GITHUB_TOKEN \
#     --build-arg PLUGIN=SkyBlock \
#     --target export --output type=local,dest=./build .
#
# Produces ./build/xSkyBlock.phar.
#
# Build arguments:
#   PLUGIN         directory of the plugin to build (SkyBlock, Bedwars, NGEssentials, ...)
#   COMPOSER_FILE  manifest to install from. Detected automatically: composer-build.json when the
#                  plugin ships one (NGEssentials, SkyBlock), otherwise composer.json. Override only
#                  to force a specific manifest.
#   PHAR_NAME      output filename; defaults to x<PLUGIN>.phar, matching the build workflow.
#                  NGEssentials is the exception and needs PHAR_NAME=NGEssentials.phar
#
# Nothing is re-downloaded between builds. The PHP release, Composer and DevTools live in a shared
# /downloads cache and are revalidated with a conditional request rather than refetched; Composer's
# own package cache is mounted at /root/.cache/composer. Dependencies are also installed before the
# plugin source is copied, so editing source does not invalidate the install layer — only the pack
# step re-runs. Building a second plugin reuses the whole toolchain.
#
# CI packs with the private pharbuilder-rs. This image uses pmmp/DevTools instead so the build works
# without private access; the resulting phar is equivalent for running a server.
